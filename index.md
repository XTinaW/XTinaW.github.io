As Picard said:

> Buried deep within you, beneath all the years of pain and anger, 
> there is something that has never been nurtured: 
> the potential to make yourself a better man. 
> And that is what it is to be human. 
> To make yourself more than you are. 
> Oh, yes â€” I know you. 
> There was a time you looked at the stars and dreamed of what might be.
